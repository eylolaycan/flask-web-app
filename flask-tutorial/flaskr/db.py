from flask import current_app, g #current app is a special object that points to the Flask application handling the request. Since you used an application factory, there is no application object when writing the rest of your code. g is a special object that is unique for each request. It is used to store data that might be accessed by multiple functions during the request. The connection is stored and reused instead of creating a new connection if get_db is called a second time in the same request.

Further, if this request connected to the database, the connection is closed. If the connection was not created, this function does nothing and the error is ignored.
